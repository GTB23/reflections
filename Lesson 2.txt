Lesson 2 git :
**************************************************************
git init - creates git repository with 0 commits
git status - check state of files / repository
git add - add files to staging area for commit


working directory -> staging area -> repository

Use the staging area to add multiple files that are part of a single logical change
This allow for a single logical commit and comments that relate to it.

git branch - shows current branches
git branch arg1 - creates branch arg1
git checkout branch_name - sets branch
git checkout -b new_branch_name, retains commits you create into a new branch
git log --graph --oneline master branch1 branch2

Master - main branch / production source
Branch - another branch for new features or bug fix
merge - combine two branches

git merge master branch_name
git show - shows changes from a commit and its parent
git branch -d branch_name - deletes a branch branch_name

automatic merges will occur when no conflicts occur
If a conflict occurs then you must manually resolve the conflict.
Once the changes are resolved, add and commit to complete the merge.
