Lesson 2 git :
**************************************************************
git init - creates git repository with 0 commits
git status - check state of files / repository
git add - add files to staging area for commit
git branch - shows current branches
git branch arg1 - creates branch arg1
git checkout branch_name - sets branch
git checkout -b new_branch_name, retains commits you create into a new branch
git log --graph --oneline master branch1 branch2
working directory -> staging area -> repository

Use the staging area to add multiple files that are part of a single logical change
This allow for a single logical commit and comments that relate to it.

Master - main branch / production source
Branch - another branch for new features or bug fix
merge - combine two branches
